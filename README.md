# About Me
Hi there ! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Chris, an HR Data Analyst<br>

I have 12 years of experience in data analysis including more the last 5+ years in HR data analysis and data-driven decision making.<br>
I'm passionate about leveraging data to provide insights that improve organizational effectiveness and optimize overall performance.<br>
<br>
Outside of work, I enjoy staying active by playing basketball and mountain biking. I also like to generate images by AI.<br>
<br>
Enough of that. Now, Github stuff.<br>
ðŸ“„ Projects<br>
Here are some of the projects I've worked on:

* [Cambridge](https://github.com/MillaBasset/cambridge) (tetro has made nice stuff on their fork, we'll see what we can do with it)
* [Cambridge Launcher](https://github.com/Rexxt/cambridge-launcher) (working to put out a working version soon)
* [HUMILIATION](https://github.com/Rexxt/humiliation-discord) and [Hachi](https://github.com/Rexxt/hachi-discord) (former is a quirky bot engine, latter is a generalist-and-splatoon-oriented bot using it)
* [Blazenet](https://github.com/Rexxt/blazenet) (working to get a good adblock ready)
* [tifm](https://github.com/Rexxt/tifm) (thinking of features to add)
* [tifer](https://github.com/Rexxt/tifer) (working to add selection)
